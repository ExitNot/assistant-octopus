# Overview  
My idea is to create personal assistant (agent) to handle my planing of the day and life. It have to be in form of Superviser Agent Architecture.

# Core Features  
List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- Agent analize my input and using multiple MCP and tools that providing him with ability to retrieve, add and update information in multiple data sources and and servicies 
- Supported tasks:
    - handles plans and schedule
    - notify about some incomming plans or to-do's 
    - read md files updating knowledge that way.
    - create tasks in my callendar
    - stores information about my habbits activities and daily notes
    - utilize vector DB (Pinecone) for retrieving my knowledge
- work with voice mode that utilize (Kyutai STT)[https://kyutai.org/next/stt] model 


# User Experience  

- User can start jorney from multiple sources:
    - Telegram client (will be implemented first)
    - Runned as local agent with ability to communicate with me as with cli so as via voice
- I can communicate with him as with regular LLM (asking questions, just chatting)
- Agent utilises other agents and instruments to manipulating with my: 
    - Plans
    - Notes
    - Reminders
    - Obsidian files (for creating own knowledge base)
    - And others in the future...

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges

Risk: Ollama local LLM performance may be insufficient for complex agent coordination
Mitigation: Implement fallback to cloud LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic) for critical operations; optimize prompts for local models; provide hardware scaling recommendations

Risk: Vector database (Pinecone) costs may escalate with large knowledge bases
Mitigation: Implement local vector alternatives (Chroma, FAISS) as fallback; add embedding caching; provide usage monitoring and alerts

Risk: Multi-agent coordination complexity may lead to inconsistent behavior
Mitigation: Start with simple supervisor pattern; implement comprehensive logging; add agent state monitoring; gradual complexity increase

Risk: Real-time voice processing latency may degrade user experience
Mitigation: Implement audio streaming; use local STT processing; add voice activity detection; provide audio quality fallbacks

## MVP Development and Feature Scope

Risk: Feature creep may delay initial deliverable and user feedback
Mitigation: Strict MVP scope enforcement; regular scope reviews; user story prioritization; time-boxed development sprints

Risk: External API dependencies (Google Calendar, Telegram) may cause system instability
Mitigation: Implement robust error handling; add API retry logic; provide offline fallback modes; monitor API health status

Risk: Data synchronization across multiple storage systems may cause inconsistencies
Mitigation: Implement eventual consistency patterns; add data validation layers; provide conflict resolution mechanisms; regular data integrity checks

## Resource Constraints

Risk: Development timeline may be overly ambitious for single developer
Mitigation: Focus on core MVP features first; leverage existing libraries and frameworks; implement automated testing early; consider phased releases

Risk: Hardware requirements may exceed available resources for local deployment
Mitigation: Provide cloud deployment options; implement resource monitoring; add performance optimization guidelines; scale features based on available resources

Risk: Ongoing operational costs (APIs, hosting, storage) may become unsustainable
Mitigation: Implement cost monitoring; provide self-hosted alternatives; add usage optimization features; plan for potential monetization
